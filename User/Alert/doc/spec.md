# Alert data model

## Description
This entity models an alert generated by a user in a givel location. This models could be used to send alerts related to traffic jam, accidents, weather conditions, high level of pollutants and so on. 
The objective of this model is to define all the data that will send to Orion Context Broker. Then, an application could suscribe to OCB and to take these informaion and to generate notifications for a user or trigger other actions.

## Alert definition
Alerts are context data generated by final users (humans) or devices, such as smartphones or software apps. Also, a Smart Spot or Cloudino could send alerts if these technologies can incorporate some type of processing device that could process data and to  determine if the data contains some data to be communicated to users. For instance, a Smart Spot could produces an alert about high levels of Ozone and in the same way the Cloudino could send alerts of strong raining to users. 

An alert is generated by a specific situation that trigger an alert. The main features of an alert is that it is not predictable and it is not a recurrent data. That means that an alert could be an accident or a high level of pollutants measure, additionally it could be the fall down of a patient or a car driving in the opposite direction.

When a user or device detects an irregular situation sends an alert to a set of users. The context data around the alert are send to the Orion Context Broker according a specific data model. Some examples of context data are: type of alert (traffic, suspicious activities, and pollution, etc.), severity, location and so on. 

A set of alerts have been detected for the project scenarios:

| Smart city  | Smart security | Smart health |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Traffic jam  | A car in opposite direction  |Fall of a patient |
| Accident cars  | When a car suddenly stops  |Bump of a patient |
| Weather condition  | Suspicious activities  | |
| High level of pollution  | Assaults | |
| Pollen | | |
| Asthma attacks || |

It is important to remark that an alert can see generated by a user or device. Currently, for smart city scenario a set of alerts have been detected, such as: traffic jam, accident cars, weather condition, pollutation, pollen and asthma attacks. In addition, for each type of alert, also a set of sub-types of alerts have been identified. For instances, subtypes of alerts of traffic jam: heavy traffic jam, car stopped on road, and so on. A catalogue of alerts subtypes for smart city scenario have been defined and it is showed to below.

###### Alert catalogue

| Traffic| Accidents | Weather conditions | Pollutions | Pollen |Asthma attacks |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Standstill Traffic Jam |Minor Accident|Rainfall|Visible pollution (smog)|Symptoms or discomforts of users| People with asthma attacks at specific point. |
| Heavy Traffic Jam |Car Accident|Temperature (low, high)|Level of emissions|Level of pollen on air| |
| Bumper to bumper traffic|Hazard On Road|Heat alert|Level of pollutants, such as O3.|Pollen concentration| |
| Moderate Traffic Jam|Assaults|Wind|Pre-contingency alert| | |
| Car Stopped On Road|Bikers injured|Flood warning|Contingency alert| | |
| Roadworks|Car crashes|dense fog|| | |
| Road closed|Suspicious activities|Tornado | | | |
| Pothole| |Tropical cyclone| | | |
| Congestion on road| |Hurricane| | | |
| Car in opposite way| |Tsunami| | | |
| When a car suddenly stops | | | | | |

In order to represent at data model the subtype of alert, the attribute "eventObserved" have been created. In this attribute, the information of subtype of alert should be added. It is neccesary to define a catalogue of alerts and sub-types of alerts.

## Alerts generated by Devices

When a device send data to Orion Context Broker, related to air quality, vehicles, parking, etc., a web service, application, or software could be suscribe to OCB. This application could have defined rules or the business logic and according the values received from OCB could generated an alerts with useful information to Users. Following, it is described a simple example of an alert generated by a device.

There is a Mobile Monitoring Unit that send data from air quality to an IoT Agent. This agent send the data in NGSI format to Orion Context Broker. Then an Activity GE is suscribed to OCB, the activity component has defined a set of rules to attend each data received from OCB. It is important comment that this component should decide if the data received is an alert or not. If the data correspond to an alert, this component generates the json file following the alert data model. 

For instance, the Mobile Monitoring Unit detects 40 grades of temperature, then it send the data to IoT agent. The Agent send the data to OCB following the air quality data model. The Activity component receives this data and the rule defined is: "if temperature > 40 grades then send an Heat Alert". Then this activity send the alert using the alert data model, and the description attribute could be added information as 241–54 °C Heat cramps and heat exhaustion are likely; heat stroke is probable with continued activity". The alert could be send to an application (alerts, routes), a smart phone, a web service, and so on. The Json file generated by Activity component could be as shown to below:

{
		"id": "Alert:1",
		"type": "Alert",
		"alertType": “Weather condition",
		"eventObserved": “Heat alert",
		"location": {
			"type": "Point",
			"coordinates": [-3.712247222222222, 40.423852777777775]
		},
		"dateTime": "2017-01-02T09:25:55.00Z",
		"description": "41–54 °C Heat cramps and heat exhaustion are likely; heat stroke is probable with continued activity.",
		"refDevice": “Device1"
}  


For this scenario, a catalogue of alerts types and thresholds should be defined. In this case, this type of alerts could added useful information for users. Also, it could be generated real alerts related to air quality, traffic, weather conditions and so on.

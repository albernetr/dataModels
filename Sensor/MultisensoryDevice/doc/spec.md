# MultisensoryDevice 

## Description

This model is built based on the FIWARE's Device entity [DEVICE](../Device), however, unlike the aforementioned model, this entity aims to provide a detailed description of a device by splitting it into integrated sensors. In this context, a multysensory device is an apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) built based on a collection of sensor, which contains some logic and is producer and / or consumer of data, and it is assumed to be capable of communicating electronically via a network.

+ `mnc` : This property identifies the Mobile Network Code (MNC) of the network the device is attached to.
The MNC is used in combination with a Mobile Country Code (MCC) (also known as a "MCC / MNC tuple")
to uniquely identify a mobile phone operator/carrier using the GSM, CDMA, iDEN, TETRA
and 3G / 4G public land mobile networks and some satellite mobile networks.
    + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text).

    + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text).
    + Optional.

+ `supportedProtocol` : See attribute `supportedProtocol` from [DeviceModel](../../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Needed if due to a software update new protocols are supported. Otherwise it is better to convey it at `DeviceModel` level.

    + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text).
    + Optional.

+ `firmwareVersion` : The firmware version of this device.
    + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text).
    + Optional.
    
+ `serialNumber` : The serial number assigned by the manufacturer.
    + Normative References: [https://schema.org/serialNumber](https://schema.org/serialNumber).
    + Optional.
    
+ `provider` : The provider of the device.
    + Normative References: [https://schema.org/provider](https://schema.org/provider).
    + Optional.

+ `batteryLevel` : Device's battery level. It must be equal to `1.0` when battery is full. `0.0` when battery Ã¬s empty.
`null` when cannot be determined. 
    + Type: [Number](https://schema.org/Number).
    + Allowed values: Interval [0,1].
    + Attribute metadata:
        + `timestamp`: Timestamp when the last update of the attribute happened.
        This value can also appear as a FIWARE [TimeInstant](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib#TimeInstant).
            + Type: [DateTime](http://schema.org/DateTime).
    + Optional.
    
+ `deviceState` : State of this device from an operational point of view. Its value can be vendor dependent.  
    + Type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text).
    + Attribute metadata:
        + `timestamp`: Timestamp when the last update of the attribute happened.
        This value can also appear as a FIWARE [TimeInstant](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib#TimeInstant).
            + Type: [DateTime](http://schema.org/DateTime).
    + Optional.

+ `refDeviceModel` : The device's model.

    + Mandatory.

+ `configuration` : Device's technical configuration. This attribute is intended to be a dictionary of properties which capture parameters which have to do with the configuration of a device (timeouts, reporting periods, etc.) and which are not currently covered by the standard attributes defined by this model. 
    + Attribute type: [StructuredValue](https://schema.org/StructuredValue).
    + Attribute metadata:
        + `dateModified` :  It captures the last modification timestamp of this attribute.

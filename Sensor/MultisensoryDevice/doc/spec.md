# Multisensory Device 

## Description

This model is built based on the Device & DeviceModel entities [DEVICE](../Device), however, rather than contextualise in the IoT scope, this model is referenced aims to overcome bonding to cover a larger variety of objects. In this context, an apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a particular task (sensing the environment, actuating, etc.). A MultisensoryDevice is constituted by a set of tangible sensors  which contains some logic and is producer and/or consumer of data, and it is assumed to be capable of communicating electronically via a network.


## Data Model

+ `id` : Unique identifier. 

+ `type` : Entity type. It must be equal to `Device`.

+ `category` : See attribute `category` from [DeviceModel](../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Optional but recommended to optimize queries.
        
+ `controlledProperty` : See attribute `controlledProperty` from [DeviceModel](../../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Optional but recommended to optimize queries.

+ `controlledAsset` : The asset(s) (building, object, etc.) controlled by the device.
    + Attribute type: List of [Text](https://schema.org) or Reference(s) to another entity.
    + Optional

+ `mnc` : This property identifies the Mobile Network Code (MNC) of the network the device is attached to.
The MNC is used in combination with a Mobile Country Code (MCC) (also known as a "MCC / MNC tuple")
to uniquely identify a mobile phone operator/carrier using the GSM, CDMA, iDEN, TETRA
and 3G / 4G public land mobile networks and some satellite mobile networks.
    + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text)
    + Optional

+ `mcc` : Mobile Country Code - This property identifies univoquely the country of the mobile network the device is attached to.
    + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text)
    + Optional
    
+ `macAddress` : The MAC address of the device.
    + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text)
    + Optional
    
+ `ipAddress` : The IP address of the device. It can be a comma separated list of values if the device has more than one IP address. 
    + Attribute type: [Text](https://schema.org/Text)
    + Optional

+ `supportedProtocol` : See attribute `supportedProtocol` from [DeviceModel](../../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Needed if due to a software update
new protocols are supported. Otherwise it is better to convey it at `DeviceModel` level. 

+ `configuration` : Device's technical configuration. This attribute is intended to be a dictionary of properties which capture
parameters which have to do with the configuration of a device (timeouts, reporting periods, etc.)
and which are not currently covered by the standard attributes defined by this model. 
    + Attribute type: [StructuredValue](https://schema.org/StructuredValue)
    + Attribute metadata:

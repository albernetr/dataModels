# Sensor Data Models

This set of data models allow to represent a single sensor as well as a set of sensors embebed into a multi-sensory device entity. Thus, detailed technical description is provided by the model. It is composed by the following entity types:

+ [Sensor](Sensor/doc/spec.md). It represents a physical sensor intended to sense a particular set of data (e.g., acceleration, orientation, temperature, etc.).
+ [SensorModel](SensorModel/doc/spec.md). This entity captures the static properties of a Sensor component.

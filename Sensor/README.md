# Sensor Data Models

This set of data models allow to represent a single sensor provided with network connection as well as a set of sensors embebed into a device, thus, detailed technical description is provided by the model. It is composed by the following entity types:

+ [Sensor](../Sensor/doc/spec.md). It represents a physical sensor (i.e., hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a particular task (e.g., to sense acceleration, gyroscope, temperature, an so on).
+ [SensorModel](../SensorModel/doc/spec.md). It captures the static properties common to multiple instances of a Sensor component.

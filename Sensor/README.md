# Sensor Data Models

This set of data models allow to represent a single sensor provided with network connection as well as a set of sensors embebed into a device, thus, detailed technical description is provided by the model. It is composed by the following entity types:

+ [Sensor](../Sensor/doc/spec.md). It represents a physical sensor intended to sense a particular category of data (e.g., acceleration, gyroscope, temperature, etc.).
+ [SensorModel](../SensorModel/doc/spec.md). This entity captures the static properties of a Sensor component.
